        Austin Richard Post was born on July 4, 1995, in Syracuse, New York. He was raised by his father, Rich Post, and his stepmother, Jodie. His father had been a disc jockey in his youth and introduced Post to many different genres of music including hip-hop, country, and rock. When Post was nine years old, he and his family moved to Grapevine, Texas, after his father became the manager of concessions for the Dallas Cowboys. Post began to play the guitar and auditioned for the band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition. He credited his initial interest in learning guitar to the popular video game Guitar Hero. <br><br> Post has always had a love for emo music, and appeared for a DJ set at Emo Nite in Los Angeles in June 2017, playing My Chemical Romance at the event. According to Post, his very first foray into professional music began when he was in a heavy metal band. Soon after, he says he transitioned to softer rock as well as hip-hop, before beginning to experiment on FL Studio.
